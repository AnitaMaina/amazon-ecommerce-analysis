## Key Findings

* **Discount Impact on Sales:** A noticeable positive correlation was observed between discount percentage and rating count in several product categories, suggesting that discounts significantly influence sales volume.
* **Rating Distribution:** The distribution of product ratings is generally skewed towards higher ratings (4 and 5 stars), indicating a positive overall customer experience. However, a significant number of products also received lower ratings, highlighting areas for improvement.
* **Top-Selling Categories:** The "Electronics" and "Home & Kitchen" categories emerged as the top-selling categories, as indicated by the highest rating counts. This suggests high demand and potential for further growth in these areas.
* **Correlation Between Discount Amount and Rating:** While there's a correlation between discount amount and rating count, it is not a strong correlation, indicating that the amount of the discount is not the only factor that effects sales.
* **Review Discrepancies:** Some products exhibited a high volume of reviews but lower average ratings, indicating potential discrepancies between customer expectations and product performance.
* **Data Quality:** Some data quality issues were observed, including missing values in rating counts and inconsistent formatting in price and discount columns, which were addressed during preprocessing.
* **Category Performance Variation:** Significant variations in average ratings and sales performance were observed across different product categories, emphasizing the need for category-specific strategies.
* **High Rated Low Review Count:** Some products had very high ratings, but very low review counts. This could indicate newer products that are very well received.# amazon-ecommerce-analysis
